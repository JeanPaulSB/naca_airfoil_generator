# NACA airfoil generator ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)

Letting you to start working with naca airfoils quickly and precisely.

## Getting Started

To start running the program is quite easy, remember that the structure as presented, airfoil is a python package that contains the corresponding tools.

_Once all the required libraries are installed_, go to "main.py" file.

### How to run it

Inside the airfoil folder, run the file "ui.py".
Then fill the required data and press the button "Plot".

```

**a few more methods will be added in future versions.**

install all the required libraries by using

```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```

Give the example

```

And repeat

```

until finished

```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```

Give an example

```

### And coding style tests
